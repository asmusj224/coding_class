## Python üêç: GUI

Graphical User interfaces (GUI) allow users to interact with your program using graphical elements instead of text based commands. Many of the applications you use today have a GUI, you click on buttons, icons, etc.

### Event-driving programming

GUI programs follow a different paradigm then the programs you have written so far. GUI programs respond to events. For example, when a user clicks on a button the program has an event handler that tells the computer what to do when the button is clicked. A GUI program uses a main loop to listen for events and calls our event handler functions.
